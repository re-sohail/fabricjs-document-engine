Safe saving. Adds dirty tracking (`isDirty`, `getSaveState`, `save:status`), autosave with a quiet-period delay and a maximum wait, one-save-at-a-time with merged follow-up saves so an older response can never overwrite newer work, stale-response protection when another document is opened, revision checks that report `SAVE_CONFLICT` when another tab or device saved first (with `save({ overwrite: true })` to keep your version), exponential backoff retries with `save:retry`, and `bindUnsavedChangesWarning`. Adds the `fabricjs-document-engine/storage` entry with `createMemoryStorage`, `createLocalStorage` and `createKeyValueStorage`. The storage adapter now receives `{ expectedRevision, signal }` as its second argument; adapters written for 0.1 keep working.
